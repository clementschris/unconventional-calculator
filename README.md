# unconventional-calculator

>> This is my first JavaScript project! A JavaScript unconventional calculator.

>> This was made following a tutorial on Udemy by Maximilian Schwartzmüller.

>> This calculator works 'unconventionally'. Different to most calculators! The initial result will read as 0 so unlike a normal calculator where you click the button before you type the number, this works the opposite way. Type the number in that you would like to add/subtract/multiply/divide and then click the corresponding button!
